HGK Feedback Form plugin adds feedback (or comment) form to any page or post.

== Description ==

HGK Feedback Form plugin adds feedback (or comment) form to any page or post. It does that by replacing '&lt;!-- hgk feedback form --&gt;' magic comment with the form's HTML. User submitted content is sent by e-mail to specified e-mail address.

HGK Feedback Form features clean look and feel similar to WordPress' standard Submit Comment form, yet it is customizable via included style.css.

The following options can be set from plugin's admin panel:

* Recipient e-mail address for user feedback submissions.
* Subject for notification e-mail.
* Message to show user in case of successful feedback submission.
* Message to show user in case of submission errors.

1. Uncompress.
1. Upload `hgk-feedback-form` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
